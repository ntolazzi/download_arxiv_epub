This simple script downloads an article from the [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and converts it into epub format
to make it suitable for ebook readers. Usage is:

    ./download_arxiv_epub.py https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0159
    
where you either pass the URL of the paper or only the ArXiv identifier (i.e. 1306.0159). The ebook version
of the paper is then saved in the same directory as the script.
